## Goals

1. Practice taking a *developmental neuroscience* perspective to psychological phenomena.
2. Illustrate how taking such a perspective does or does not inform understanding about a particular phenomenon.

## Activity

1. Choose a psychological domain that interests you.
2. In the spirit of [@Blumberg2023-fs], write a short essay (3-5 pp) where you apply a developmental neuroscience perspective to the domain.  In doing so, concisely answer the following questions:
  - How does psychological functioning change over development?
  - What brain systems are most directly implicated in the phenomenon?
  - Does our current understanding of developmental patterns in these systems provide useful information about the domain?
  - What information about brain structure or function is needed to understand the phenomenon more thoroughly?
