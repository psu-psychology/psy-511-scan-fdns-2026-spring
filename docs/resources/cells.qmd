## Why psychologists should care about the cellular level of analysis

### Single-celled organisms behave

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/QGAm6hMysTA?rel=0 >}}

@Purushotham2007-ne

- [*Escherichia Coli (E. Coli)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli)
  - Tiny, single-celled bacterium
  - Feeds on glucose
  - Chemo ("taste") receptors on surface membrane
  - Flagellum for movement
  - Food concentration regulates duration of "move" phase
  - ~4 ms for chemical signal to diffuse from anterior/posterior

### Learn

![@Eckert2024-hd](../include/img/eckert-etal-2024.png)

### Use communication mechanisms similar to multicellular organisms

::: {.callout-important}
### Biological communication channels

- Electrical
    + Fast(er) (10-100x)
    + Within neurons
    + From one part of body to another
    - Point-to-point connections for specificity
    - Metabolically costly to create & maintain
    - How to reliably send a message from here to there?
- Chemical
    + Diffusion slow(er)
    + Within & between neurons 
    + or other cells
    - Molecular matching (binding) for specificity
    - Metabolically efficient
:::

#### [*Paramecium*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramecium)
  - 300K larger than E. Coli
  - Propulsion through coordinated beating of cilia
  - Diffusion from head to tail ~40 s!
  - Use *electrical* signaling instead
    - $Na^+$ channel opens (e.g., when stretched)
    - Voltage-gated $Ca^{++}$ channels open, $Ca^{++}$ enters, triggers cilia
    - Signal across cell within ms
    
### [*Caenorhabditis Elegans (C. Elegans)*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caenorhabditis_elegans) 

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/GgZHziFWR7M?rel=0 >}}

@Bio-Rad-Laboratories2013-so

- ~10x larger than paramecium
- multicellular invertebrate
- 302 neurons (118 classes) + 56 glial cells (out of 959 total cells) [@Hobert2010-dl]
- Swim, forage, mate

### So, why do large/complex animals need nervous systems?

- Chemical communication specific (neurotransmitters $\rightarrow$ receptors)
- Energy efficient
- But slow

::: {.callout-note}
## Brain energetics

>The human brain is just 2% of the body’s weight, but 20% of its metabolic load, and 10 times more expensive per gram than muscle. On the other hand, the brain manages to produce poetry, design spacecraft, and create art on an energy budget of 20 W, a paltry sum given that the computer on which this article is being typed requires 80 W.

## Cellular neuroanatomy

### How many neurons and glia?

- Old "lore": ~100 billion neurons
- New estimate [@azevedo2009equal]:
    + ~86 +/- 8 billion neurons
    + ~85 +/- 9 billion glia

> *"These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain."*

**Morphology, physiology, gene transcription**

![[Figure 1 from @Zeng2017-sg]. Neurons can be classified using morphological, physiological and molecular criteria. a | Representative examples of five subclasses of cortical neurons obtained from brain slices. The cells were filled with biocytin, stained and imaged following patch clamp recording (see part b). Each subclass has distinct morphological features. For the four interneurons on the left, the dendrites are shown in dark grey and the axons in light grey. The soma of the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 3A-expressing (HTR3A+) sparse neuro- gliaform cell is located in layer 1, and its axons are also concentrated in this layer. The vasoactive intestinal peptide-expressing (VIP+) bipolar cell has a characteristic bipolar dendritic extension. The soma of the somatostatin-expressing (SST+) deep Martinotti cell is located in layer 5/6, and its axons extend upward into layer 1. The parvalbumin-expressing (PVALB+) basket cell has basket-like axonal arborisation. For the excitatory neuron on the right, the apical dendrites are shown in dark grey and the basal dendrites in light grey. This is a layer 5, thick-tufted cell from a retinol-binding protein 4 (Rbp4) gene promoter-driven Cre-expressing mouse. The cell features thick apical dendritic tufts extending into layer 1. These morphological features are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. b | Differential electrophysiological responses of the five subclasses of neurons shown in part a to square pulses of current in patch clamp recordings. For example, the HTR3A+ cell is late spiking, whereas the PVALB+ cell is fast spiking. These responses are consistent with those described in published reports49,130,140. c | Differential molecular signatures of the five subclasses of cortical neurons illustrated in part a derived from single-cell RNA-sequencing data. The violin plot shows the collective gene expression profile for each gene of all the cells in a type (cluster). We define the smallest discrete clusters of cells as types and the aggregates of types that share common features as classes or subclasses. Each transcriptomic cell type is shown as a column of data points with the same colour (the colour coding corresponds to that of the transcriptomic taxonomy shown in Fig. 5). Shown here are three interneuron cell types expressing Htr3a but notVip, six interneuron cell types expressing Vip, six interneuron cell types expressing Sst and seven interneuron cell types expressing Pvalb. All of the interneurons express glutamate decarboxylase 1 (Gad1). Also shown are eight layer 5 excitatory neuron types, all of which express solute carrier family 17 member 7 (Slc17a7). All of the cells express synaptosome-associated protein 25 (Snap25). The height of each 'violin'-shaped data point represents the range of expression levels of the gene, and the width represents the proportion of cells displaying a particular level of expression. Parts a and b are from the Allen Cell Types Database (see Further Information). Part c is adapted with permission from Ref. 136.](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrn.2017.85/MediaObjects/41583_2017_Article_BFnrn201785_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp)

![[Figure 6 from @Zeng2017-sg]. The figure shows a proposed hierarchical classification of cells in the retina (a) and cerebral cortex (b). In both areas, individual cell types can be grouped into classes, and intermediate levels of subclasses can be determined based on distinct morphological, physiological and molecular features. Higher-order groupings (such as those shown in part a, including sensory neurons, interneurons and projection neurons) may emerge once enough areas have been provided and compared. Types are the commonly recognized ('validated') terminal branches in the current hierarchical arrangement of cell types. Lower-order groupings into subtypes may largely be provisional until additional data are collected that could determine if they could form new types or should be merged into other types. Dashed lines indicate the presence of additional types that cannot be labelled due to lack of space. The question marks in part a indicate that the hierarchical relationship among the indicated cell types remains unclear. The question mark in part b indicates that the status of the cortical cell groups indicated may be either subclasses, types or subtypes.

## Neurophysiology

### Electrical communication

- Electrical potential (== voltage)
    + Think of potential energy
    + Voltage ~ pressure
    + Energy that will be released if something changes

#### Basic principles

$$E = IR$$

- Current flow ($I$) across membrane
- Membrane varies in resistance ($R$) or permeability ($1/R$) to ion flow
- Product $IR$ is electrical voltage $E$

![Simple circuit schematic](https://ka-perseus-images.s3.amazonaws.com/16b4aecbaae9e2a5e0b50fc70ace724f471ad0c0.svg)

- Membrane stores (& releases) charge like *capacitor*

![How capacitors work; http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/imgele/capchg.png](../include/img/capchg.png)

### Resting potential

- Potential energy
    - Energy that could be released if circumstances change
    
    
![](http://physics20project.weebly.com/uploads/1/6/4/8/16484122/1358825569.png)

- Measurement
    + Electrode on inside
    + Electrode on outside (reference)
    + Inside - Outside = potential

![](http://www.physiologyweb.com/lecture_notes/resting_membrane_potential/figs/measuring_the_membrane_potential_w.jpg)

- Neuron (and other cells) have *potential energy*
    + Inside is -60-70 mV, with respect to outside
    + ~1/20th typical $1.5V$ AAA  battery
- Like charges repel, opposites attract, so
    + Positively charged particles pulled in
    + Negatively charged particles pushed out
    
#### Contributors to

- Ions
  - Potassium, $K^+$
  - Sodium, $Na^+$
  - Chloride, $Cl^-$
  - Calcium, $Ca^{++}$
  - Organic anions, $A^-$
- Ion channels
- Separation between charges
- A balance of forces

#### Party metaphor

- Annie ($A^-$) was having a party.
    + Used to date Nate ($Na^+$), but now sees Karl ($K^+$)
- Hired bouncers called
    + "The Channels"
    + Let Karl and friends in or out, keep Nate out
- Annie's friends ($A^-$) and Karl's ($K^+$) mostly inside
- Nate and friends ($Na^+$) mostly outside
- Claude/Claudia ($Cl^-$) tagging along

![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_HtLvymcBlKo/TJJ9YcQNAtI/AAAAAAAAAB8/E2bzWvAzBew/s1600/10.png)

#### Ion channels

- Macromolecules that form openings in membrane
- Different types of subunits

![[Figure 1 from @Moss2001-tb]](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2F35067500/MediaObjects/41583_2001_Article_BF35067500_Fig1_HTML.gif?as=webp)

- Selective (bind only to some substances, not others)
- Vary in permeability (allow some substances to pass more than others)
- Types
    + Passive/leak
    + Voltage-gated
    + Ligand-gated (chemically-gated)
    + Transporters

![](https://o.quizlet.com/llrX-BszQf7YdSzCVg-9.A.png)

#### Conditions

**Neuron at rest permeable to $K^+$**

- Passive $K^+$ channels open
- $[K^+]_{i} >> [K^+]_{o}$
- $K^+$ flows out

![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Diffusion.en.svg/1000px-Diffusion.en.svg.png)

- Force of diffusion
    + $K^+$ moves from high concentration (~140 mM inside) to low (~4 mM outside)
    + $K^+$ outflow would stop when $[K^+]_{o} == [K^+]_{i}$
    + But...
        
- Na/Ka-ATPase (Na/K Pump)
    - Keeps concentration gradients
    - Moves $K+$ in, $Na+$ out

- Electrostatic pressure
    + $K^+$ has + electric charge
    + Movement of charged $K^+$ ions creates current
    + Movement of charged $K^+$ ions creates charge separation
        - Some $A^-$ no longer have matching $K^+$
        - Charge separation across membrane creates voltage (~ capacitor)
    + Voltage build-up stops $K^+$ outflow
    + Voltage magnitude called "reversal potential" or equilibrium potential
    + $K^+$ positive, so reversal potential negative (w/ respect to outside)
    + $K^+$ reversal potential (~90mV) close to, but more negative than neuron resting potential (-70mV)
    
**Equilibrium potential and the Nernst equation**

![Nernst equation](http://www.physiologyweb.com/lecture_notes/resting_membrane_potential/figs/nernst_equation_v_k.gif)

**Neuron at resting potential has low $Na^+$ permeability**

- $Na^+$ concentrated outside neuron ($[Na^+]_{o}$~145 mM) vs. inside ($[Na^+]_{i}$~12 mM)
- Equilibrium potential is positive (with respect to outside)
- Some $Na^+$ flows *in*

- Calculate net effects of ion flow across membrane via
- Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation

**Summary of forces**

| Ion | Concentration gradient | Force of diffusion  | Sign of electrostatic force |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| $K^+$  | $[K^+]_{i} >> [K^+]_{o}$ | outward        | -     |
| $Na^+$ | $[Na^+]_{i} << [Na^+]_{o}$ | inward       | -     |

- "Driving Force" on a given ion depends on its equilibrium potential AND current membrane potential.
- Driving force >> if membrane potential far from equilibrium potential for ion.
- *Equilibrium potential*
    + Voltage that keeps current (inside/outside) concentrations the same
    + Voltage membrane potential will approach if **only** that ion flows

**[Equilibrium potentials](http://www.physiologyweb.com/calculators/nernst_potential_calculator.html)**

Under typical conditions

| Ion | [inside]  | [outside]    | Voltage    |
|-----|-----------|--------------|------------|
| $K^+$  | ~150 mM   | ~4 mM        | ~ -90 mV    |
| $Na^+$ | ~10 mM    | ~140 mM      | ~ +55-60 mV |
| $Cl-$ | ~10 mM    | ~110 mM      | - 65-80 mV  |

### Action potential

![Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4a/Action_potential.svg/300px-Action_potential.svg.png)

- Rapid rise, fall of membrane potential
- Threshold of excitation
- Increase (rising phase/depolarization)
- Peak
    + at positive voltage
- Decline (falling phase/repolarization)
- Return to resting potential (refractory period)

::: {.callout-note}

**The $K^+$ story**

- $Na^+$/$K^+$ pump pulls $K^+$ **in**
- $[K^+]_{in}$ (~150 mM) >> $[K^+]_{out}$ (~4 mM)
- Outward flow of $K^+$ through passive/leak channels
- Outflow stops when *membrane potential*, $V_m$ = *equilibrium potential* for $K^+$

**Equilibrium potential**

- Voltage ($V_{K}$) that keeps system in equilibrium
    - $[K^+]_{in}$ >> $[K^+]_{out}$
- Nernst equation
    - $V_{K}$ = $\frac{RT}{(+1)F}ln(\frac{[K^+]_{out}}{[K^+]_{in}})$
    - $V_{K}$ = ~ -90 mV
    - Negative in/positive out keeps in/out concentration gradient
- $K^+$ flows out through passive/leak channels; most remains near membrane
- Separation from $A^-$ creates charge $\frac{K+K+K+K+K+}{A-A-A-A-A-}$ along capacitor-like membrane
- $V_m$ -> $V_{K}$

**The $Na^+$ story**

- $Na^+$/$K^+$ pump pushes $Na^+$ **out**
- $[Na^+]_{in}$ (~10 mM) << $[Na^+]_{out}$ (~140 mM)
- Equilibrium potential for $Na^+$, $V_{Na}$ = ~ +55 mV
    - Inside positive/outside negative to maintain outside > inside concentration gradient
- If $Na^+$ alone, $V_m$ -> $V_{Na}$ (~ +55 mV)

**"Resting" potential**

- Sum of outward $K^+$ and inward $Na^+$
    - Membrane more permeable to $K^+$ than $Na^+$, $p_{$K^+}$>$p_{Na^+}$
    - Outward flow of $K^+$ > inward flow of $Na^+$
    - Resting potential (~-70 mV) closer to $V_{K}$ (-90 mV) than $V_{Na}$ (+55 mV)
- Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation
    - $V_m = \frac{RT}{F}ln(\frac{p_{K^+}[K^+]_{out}+p_{Na^+}[Na^+]_{out}}{p_{K^+}[K^+]_{in}+p_{Na^+}[Na^+]_{in}})$

#### Components

| Phase             | Neuron State |

##### Neuron at rest

- Driving force on $K^+$ weakly <span class="red">outward</span>
    - -70 mV - (-90 mV) = +20 mV
- Driving force on $Na^+$ strongly <span class="green">inward</span>
    - -70 mV - (+55 mV) = -125 mV
- $Na^+$/$K^+$ pump maintains concentrations ($Na^2$ out; $K^+$ in)
    - $[K^+]_{i} >> [K^+]_{o}$
    - $[Na^+]_{i} << [Na^+]_{o}$

![](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/imgbio/actpot4.gif)

| Phase | Ion | Driving force | Flow direction | Flow magnitude |
|-------|-----|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Rest  | $K^+$  | 20 mV         | out            | small          |
|       | $Na^+$ | 125 mV        | in             | small          |

##### Rising phase

- Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels open
- Membrane permeability to $Na^+$ increases
    - $Na^+$ inflow through passive + voltage-gated channels
    - continued $K^+$ outflow through passive channels

![](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/imgbio/actpot4.gif)

| Phase | Ion | Driving force | Flow direction | Flow magnitude |
|-------|-----|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Rising| $K^+$  | growing       | out            | growing        |
|       | $Na^+$ | shrinking     | in             | high           |


##### Peak

- Membrane permeability to $Na^+$ reverts to resting state
    - Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels close & inactivate
    - Slow inflow due to small driving force (+30 mV - 55mV = -25 mv)
- Membrane permeability to $K^+$ increases
    - Voltage-gated $K^+$ channels open
    - Fast outflow due to strong driving force (+30 mv - (-90 mv) = +120 mV)

![](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/imgbio/actpot4.gif)

| Phase | Ion | Driving force | Flow direction | Flow magnitude |
|-------|-----|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Peak  | $K^+$  | 120 mV        | out            | high           |
|       | $Na^+$ | 20 mV         | in            | small          |

##### Falling phase

- $K^+$ outflow
    - Through voltage-gated $K^+$ and passive $K^+$ channels
- $Na^+$ inflow
    - Through passive channels only

![](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/imgbio/actpot4.gif)

| Phase | Ion | Driving force | Flow direction | Flow magnitude |
|-------|-----|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Falling | K | shrinking     | out            | high           |
|       | $Na^+$ | growing       | in             | small          |

##### Refractory phase

**Absolute**

- Cannot generate action potential (AP) no matter the size of the stimulus
- Membrane potential more negative (-90 mV) than at rest (-70 mV)
- Voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels still inactivated
    - Driving force on $Na^+$ high (-90 mv - 55 mV = -145 mV), but too bad
- Voltage-gated $K^+$ channels closing
    - Driving force on $K^+$ tiny or absent
- $Na^+$/$K^+$ pump restoring concentration balance

![](http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Biology/imgbio/actpot4.gif)

**Relative**

- Can generate AP with larg(er) stimulus
- Some voltage-gated $Na^+$ 'de-inactivate', can open if
    - Larger input
    - Membrane potential is more negative than resting potential

|-------|-----|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| Refractory | K | ~0 mV      | out            | small          |
|       | $Na^+$ | 145 mV        | in             | small          |

#### APs and Information Processing

- AP amplitudes don't vary (much)
    + All or none
    - $V_{K}$ and $V_{Na}$ don't vary much b/c $Na^+$/$K^+$ pump always working
- AP frequency and timing vary
    + Rate vs. timing codes
    - Same rates, but different timing
    - "Grandmother" cells and single spikes

#### Generating action potentials

- *Axon hillock*
    + Portion of soma adjacent to axon
    + Integrates/sums input to soma
- *Axon initial segment*
    + Umyelinated portion of axon adjacent to soma
    + Voltage-gated $Na^+$ and $K^+$ channels exposed
    + If sum of input to soma > threshold, voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels open

![Wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/Axon_Hillock.png)
    
#### Propagation

- Propagation
    + move down axon, away from soma, toward axon terminals.
- Unmyelinated axon
    + Each segment "excites" the next

{{< video https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0K2dvB-7WY >}}

- Myelinated axon
    + AP "jumps" between *Nodes of Ranvier* --> *saltatory conduction*
    + Nodes of Ranvier == unmyelinated sections of axon
    + voltage-gated $Na^+$, $K^+$ channels exposed
    + Current flows through myelinated segments
    
- Why does AP flow in one direction, away from soma?
    + Soma does not have (many) voltage-gated $Na^+$ channels.
    + Soma is not myelinated.
    + Refractory periods mean polarization only in one direction.

## Synaptic transmission

*Synapse* permits neuron to pass electrical or chemical messages to another neuron or target cell (muscle, gland, etc.)

### Synapse Types & Locations

- Chemical
- Electrical
  - Gap junctions
  - *Cytosol* (and ionic current) flows through adjacent neurons 

![https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gap_cell_junction-en.svg#/media/File:Gap_cell_junction-en.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b7/Gap_cell_junction-en.svg/1200px-Gap_cell_junction-en.svg.png)

### Steps in chemical transmission

- *Voltage-gated calcium Ca++ channels* open
- $Ca^{++}$ influx causes *synaptic vesicles* to bind with presynaptic membrane, fuse with membrane, spill contents via *exocytosis*

![Figure 1 from @Haucke2011-ub](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnrn2948/MediaObjects/41583_2011_Article_BFnrn2948_Fig1_HTML.jpg?as=webp)

- NTs diffuse across *synaptic cleft*
- NTs bind with *receptors* on *postsynaptic membrane*
  - Cause some post-synaptic effect
- NTs unbind from receptor
- NTs inactivated
- NTs diffuse along concentration gradient

![Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3ASynapseSchematic_en.svg](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/30/SynapseSchematic_en.svg/512px-SynapseSchematic_en.svg.png)

**Relative sizes**

- Neural membrane ~8 nm
- Synaptic vesicles ~40-60 or ~90-120 nm
- Synaptic cleft ~20-50 nm
- Cleft small relative to vesicles

### Receptor/channel types

#### Leak/passive

- Vary in selectivity, permeability

#### Transporters/exchangers

+ Ionic
    * $Na^+$/$K^+$ ATP-ase/pump
+ Chemical
    * e.g., Dopamine transporter (DAT)

#### Ionotropic receptors (receptor + ion channel)

- Ligand-gated
- Open/close channel
- Ions flow in/out depending on membrane voltage and ion type
- Fast-responding (< 2 ms), but short-duration effects (< 100 ms)

#### Metabotropic receptors (receptor only)

- G-proteins ->
- Trigger 2nd messengers
- Open/close adjacent channels, change metabolism

![http://webvision.med.utah.edu/imageswv/GLU5.jpeg](http://webvision.med.utah.edu/imageswv/GLU5.jpeg)

### Receptors generate *postsynaptic potentials (PSPs)*

- Small voltage changes
- Amplitude scales with # of receptors activated
- *Excitatory PSPs (EPSPs)*
    + Depolarize neuron (make more +)
- *Inhibitory (IPSPs)*
    + Hyperpolarize neuron (make more -)

### NTs inactivated

- Buffering
    + e.g., glutamate into astrocytes [@GLIA:GLIA10]
- *Reuptake* via *[transporters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurotransmitter_transporter)*
    + e.g., serotonin via serotonin transporter (SERT)
- Enzymatic degradation
    + e.g., acetylcholine esterase (AChE) degrades acetylcholine (ACh)

### Questions to ponder

- Why do NTs diffuse from pre- to post-synaptic membrane?
- Why must NTs be inactivated?
- What sort of PSP would *opening* a $Na^+$ channel produce?
- What sort of PSP would *opening* a $Cl^-$ channel produce?
- What sort of PSP would *closing* a $K^+$ produce?

- on dendrites
    + usually excitatory 
- on cell bodies
    + usually inhibitory 
- on axons 
    + usually modulatory (change p(fire))
