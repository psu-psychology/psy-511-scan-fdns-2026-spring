## About the course

The first scientific psychologists were physiologists fascinated by the possibility of understanding the mind by studying the brain.
In this course, we will explore the historical roots and contemporary challenges associated with the study of biological approaches to complex adaptive behavior.
In doing so, we will read and examine critically primary source readings that discuss basic patterns and processes of brain structure and function.
The goal is to provide students with a basic foundation of knowledge about the structures and functions of the nervous system that can provide the basis for future study.

This course is one of two required courses for the [Specialization in Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN)](https://psych.la.psu.edu/graduate/program-areas/cross-cutting-program-initiatives/scan/).

## Prerequisites

Undergraduate coursework in neuroscience or physiological psychology such as the equivalents of PSYCH 260 or BIO 469/470.
