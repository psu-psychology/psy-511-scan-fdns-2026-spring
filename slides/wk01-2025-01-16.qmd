# Why neuroscience is harder than physics

## What do we need to know to answer the question?

- What is the state...
    - Of the world ($W$)
    - Of the organism
        - Body ($B$)
        - Nervous system ($N$)
        - Mind ($M$)

## Nested state spaces

---

![](../include/img/nested-causality-labels.png)

## Some states are more easily measured than others

- $W$, $B$, $N$ (more or less) **directly**

---

![@Sejnowski2014-aa](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fnn.3839/MediaObjects/41593_2014_Article_BFnn3839_Fig1_HTML.jpg)

## Mental states ($M$)

- Measured **indirectly**
- Via $N$, $B$, $W$
- Do you agree?

## What are essential components/dimensions of $W$?

- To explain/understand $B$ (and $M$)

## What are essential components/dimensions of $B$?

- To explain/understand 

## Brain & behavior are complex, dynamic *systems* with

- Components
- Interactions
- Forces/influences
- Boundaries
- Inputs/outputs/processes

## Systems...

- "Behave" or change state across time
- Return to starting state
- Appear to be regulated, controlled, influenced by feedback loops
- $B(t+1) = f(W(t), B(t), N(t), M(t))$

## May be analyzed of as [networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_science)

## At multiple levels of organization...

## Biological systems not "designed"

- ...like human-engineered ones

![https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture](../include/img/Computer_architecture_block_diagram.png)

## Studying such systems is hard because...

- Change structure/function over time
- Hard to measure what is being exchanged, what is being *controlled*

## Assumptions are problematic

# Course overview

## Goals

- Master fundamentals of neuroscientific concepts and facts
- Prepare to read primary source literature in social, behavioral, cognitive, affective, and clinical neuroscience

## Structure

<https://psu-psychology.github.io/psy-511-scan-fdns-2025-spring/>

## Questions

- What is the basic organizational plan of the nervous system?
- How do neurons work?
- How do neurons connected in networks achieve behavioral goals?
- How does the nervous system develop? How has it evolved?
- How do disorders of the mind reveal themselves in the nervous system?

## Approach

- Brain architecture (neuroanatomy)
- Brain function (neurophysiology)
- Brain communication (neurochemistry)
- Changes over evolutionary and developmental time

## Approach

- The nervous system as an information processing system

![Wikipedia](../include/img/Information_processing_system.PNG)

## Mindful of limitations in brain/computer metaphors

![https://www.explainthatstuff.com/howcomputerswork.html](https://cdn4.explainthatstuff.com/how-computer-works.png)

## Or inspired by richer metaphors

![@Becker2021-bd](../include/img/1*QvKZpHrmz1nWyK4VfY2VTg.png)

## Inputs

- From environment, body, brain

## Processing

- Current inputs + brain state + body state + possible future states...
- Stored information
- Physiological & behavioral goals

---

## Outputs

- To brain, body, environment

## Mapping structures to functions...

![@Cisek2019-vq Figure 8](https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.3758%2Fs13414-019-01760-1/MediaObjects/13414_2019_1760_Fig8_HTML.png)

## And *vice versa*?

![@Cepelewicz2021-hq](../include/img/quanta-2021.png)

>"The brainwide representation of behavioral variables suggests that information encoded nearly anywhere in the forebrain is combined with behavioral state variables into a mixed representation...Our data indicate that it happens as early as primary sensory cortex."

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Stringer2019-vf
</p>

## And do we have the right "psychological" structures?

>Psychological sciences have identified a wealth of cognitive processes and behavioral phenomena, yet struggle to produce cumulative knowledge. Progress is hamstrung by siloed scientific traditions and a focus on explanation over prediction...

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Eisenberg2019-iy
</p>

---

>...two issues that are particularly damaging for the study of **multifaceted constructs like self-regulation**...We conclude that self-regulation lacks coherence as a construct...

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Eisenberg2019-iy
</p>

## "Behavioural biologists don't agree on what constitutes behaviour"

>Behavioural biology is a major discipline within biology, centred on the key concept of ‘behaviour’. But how is ‘behaviour’ defined, and how should it be defined? We outline what characteristics we believe a scientific definition should have, and why we think it is important... 

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Levitis2009-br
</p>

---

>...that a definition have these traits. We then examine the range of available published definitions for behaviour. 

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Levitis2009-br
</p>

---

>Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term. Here again, we find surprisingly widespread disagreement as to what qualifies as behaviour. Respondents contradict themselves...

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Levitis2009-br
</p>


---

>...each other, and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of `behaviour.'

<p style="text-align:center;">
@Levitis2009-br
</p>

---

>We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: "Behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes."

## Marr's Three Levels

![@Favela2020-uc Figure 3](../include/img/wcs1525-fig-0003-m.jpg)

---

- What must be computed to carry out task X?
- What algorithm is used to carry out the computation?
- What hardware implements the algorithm?

## Computational level

- What has to be computed?
  - What is the shape/form of that unknown object?
  - What did that person just say?
  - Is that unknown object a threat to me?
  
## Algorithmic level

- What's the 'recipe' for...
  - computing shape
  - perceiving speech
  - recognizing threats

## Implementation level

- How do...
  - neurons
  - areas
  - networks
- implement the recipe?

## Causality in neuroscience

- @Siddiqi2022-wl
- Stimulation & lesion studies needed for inferring *causation*.
- Bradford-Hill criteria [@Hill2015-jb]

## Varied notions of mechanism

## Does neuroscience need behavior? 

Krakauer, J. W., Ghazanfar, A. A., Gomez-Marin, A., MacIver, M. A., & Poeppel, D. (2017). Neuroscience needs behavior: Correcting a reductionist bias. *Neuron*, *93*(3), 480–490. <https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.12.041>.

Parada, F. J. & Rossi, A. (2018). If neuroscience needs behavior, what does psychology need? *Frontiers in Psychology*, *9*, 433. <https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00433>.

## Key points

- Questions 'often tacit...belief in the reductionist program for understanding the link between brain and behavior'
- Behavior -> understanding; neural interventions -> causality
- Marr's 3 levels (computation; algorithm; implementation)

## But what is behavior?

## "Behavioural biologists don't agree on what constitutes behaviour"

>..."Behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes."
